Most wave models consider a fully developed, open ocean. Whilst WAVEWATCH III (WW3) and other wave models have algorithms such as obstruction grids, two-way nesting and the mosiac approach 

# Shorelines and Bathymetric Data

Firstly, it was important to define the shorelines and depth of the ocean. Initially, data from the Gloabl Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database (GSHHG) was used, following a paper on the utility of obstruction grids for WW3.
